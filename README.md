# AccountSystem
An accounting system for the CMPG323 module built for Discovery Vitality. 

This is back end only, and is developed using the Springboot framework.
In this system 

I used dependencies such as Hibernate for maniging my MySQL
database. This database has full entity relationships and key constraints.
